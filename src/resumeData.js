  aboutme:
    "I am a prefinal year student pursuing  B.tech(CSE)[2017-2021] at IIIT, Gwalior. I have worked in three agile companies, Innovaccer, WhatsurSkill and Trybotics. At Innovaccer I worked in a team to develop products for the US Healthcare Industry and gained experience in writing production-ready code in React.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS. I also got the insights of server-side rendering while working for Trybotics where we were able to achieve up to 90% performance boost by refactoring the existing React code. These internships provided me with a great platform to put skills as a software developer to action. I have done multiple projects in Web Development using Javascript, Node.js, React.js, MySQL, MongoDB. I also tried my hands in open source and have made few contributions to FOSSASIA organisation and also published my own npm package having 300+ downloads.I also have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms.",
